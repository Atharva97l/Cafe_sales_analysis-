# Cafe Sales Analysis

## Description
This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a messy cafe sales dataset for analysis.  
The raw data contained inconsistent text values, missing numeric fields, and corrupted entries.  
Using Python and Pandas, the dataset was cleaned, standardized, and logically reconstructed.  
Exploratory analysis and visualizations were later created, including dashboards in Power BI.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Power BI (power query)
  

## Data Cleaning Steps
- Standardized text columns and handled invalid entries
- Converted corrupted numeric columns to proper numeric types
- Logically reconstructed missing values using relationships between Quantity, Price per Unit, and Total Spent
- Renamed columns for consistency
- Exported cleaned data for further analysis and visualization

## Visualization
